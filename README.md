# Real-Life-Data-Analysis-of-the-Gaming-Industry
This project is to determine the Game Publisher with the highest number of production and highest Global Sales Performance using MatPlotlib, as well to build a Game Recommendation System using Pandas and Seaborn.

Answering so many questions like:
 Will the Publisher with the highest number of production correlates the Global Sales?
 Will the Year with the highest number of production correlates the year with the highest game Global Sales?

For the Game recommendation system, the model will be trained to suggest game to users based on preferred genre.
