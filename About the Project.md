# Real-Life-Data-Analysis-of-the-Gaming-Industry
This project is to determine the Game Publisher with the highest number of production and highest Global Sales Performance using MatPlotlib, as well to build a Game Recommendation System using Pandas and Seaborn.

Answering so many questions like:
 _Will the Publisher with the highest number of production correlates the Global Sales?_
 _Will the Year with the highest number of production correlates the year with the highest game Global Sales?_

For the Game recommendation system, the model will be trained to suggest game to users based on preferred genre.
